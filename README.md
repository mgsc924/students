# "Code Bending"
CC 206 students' repository for practicing doing pull requests. Introduce yourself via a <firstname_initials+lastname>.md file under the appropriate [`_data/SCHOOL_YEAR/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. See [the example file](_data/2021/mjsolidarios.md), duplicate, rename and replace its contents with your own **emoji** (see [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)), **about_me** and **hugot_lines/other_stuffs**.

Be creative!
