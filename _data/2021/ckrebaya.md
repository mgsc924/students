here's a four-leaf :four_leaf_clover: for y'all! (for good luck this academic year :wink:)

about_me
> Hi, I'm Clarence. Commonly mistaken as a he (because of my name) but I'm a she. I'm 4'9 tall (not tall at all though :laughing:). I'm 21 but don't look like one. I'm in between of an introvert and an extrovert - an ambivert, you may say. I love watching anime and reading manga. Romantic-Comedy is my favorite genre. I plan on coming to Japan in the near future. Cherry Blossom Trees are too pretty not to see in this lifetime :cherry_blossom: :blush:

What I believe in
> Always choose to be kind. Some people might abuse you but worry not, karma got your back. :wink:
