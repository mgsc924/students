about_me
>  Hello there I am **Hans**! I like to code and watch YouTube videos a lot. I started learning coding seriously only this college, though my father used to make me watch coding videos before but I had not interest back then. Although I haven't gone deep into it, I love to learn about Linux and the different distros that come with it, someday I wish to become an open-souce contributor as well.
