about_me
>  Annyeonghaseyo! You can call me Hyacinth but Mioten will be nice since that's how most people call me. I love watching meme videos and spoiled children getting abolished.
All jokes aside, I am currently learning how to edit and enhance photos and videos using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere. I also love taking photographs, travelling,
and go out and discover places that are yet to be discovered.

> "You're sacrifice today is your iPhone tomorrow." charrr. Though this is not a hugot line, this quote is my favorite since: "Simplicity is the best sophistication."

Thank you and please let us all be safe!
